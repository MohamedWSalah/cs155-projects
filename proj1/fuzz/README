1. The crash occurs at 0x080a80b5 <+2709>. The assembly instructions are below.
   0x080a809c <+2684>:	89 8e 44 00 03 00	mov    %ecx,0x30044(%esi)
   0x080a80a2 <+2690>:	88 1f	mov    %bl,(%edi)
   0x080a80a4 <+2692>:	8b 56 38	mov    0x38(%esi),%edx
   0x080a80a7 <+2695>:	eb 17	jmp    0x80a80c0 <next_code+2720>
   0x080a80a9 <+2697>:	8d b4 26 00 00 00 00	lea    0x0(%esi,%eiz,1),%esi
   0x080a80b0 <+2704>:	0f b6 5c 16 44	movzbl 0x44(%esi,%edx,1),%ebx
=> 0x080a80b5 <+2709>:	88 5d 00	mov    %bl,0x0(%ebp)

2. From exploring the source code and reading the discussion online, the root cause of the crash appears to be an integer overflow. next_code is called recursively, and we see the following values of "code": 257, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 2, 257 (crash!). It seems that this leads to an invalid state in memory which eventually causes us to try to addres a memory address we don't have access to, leading to the crash in the program.

3. The adversary can replicate the crash simply by attempting to unzip any of the files in the results/crash directory. The most straight-forward use of this crash is to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) attack on any systems running "bsdtar" to unzip input data. For example, a server which accepts compressed network data and uncompresses it locally. In that case, the adversary would simply send these crafted files and crash the service, making it unusuable to others. Alternatively, if the service runs threads, we could instead send the files in the resuls/hangs directory and force the threads to hang.
